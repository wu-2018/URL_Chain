# URL Chain  

A lightweight Android App for manipulating web links.  
Currently support:  
- downloading articles from wechat
- generating QRcode  

Since the goal was to write more in Python, less in Java, and avoid rebuild wheels, so this app itself won't work, it just transmits the link to [python scripts](termux/) that runs within Termux.  

*When time permits, I'll write a more detailed intro*
